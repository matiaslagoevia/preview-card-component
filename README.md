## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Flex approach to center main content and footer helped on this too
- Flex items' images have `align-self: start` implicitly, stretching them
- Font-sizes in `rem`, everything else (padding, margins, etc) in `em`
- Styling buttons with `:hover` pseudoclass
- Controlling flex containers' direction & wrap with `flex-flow`
- Specifying `max-width` alongside `width` for containers to prevent them growing too much
- Using `margin: 0 auto` to center content horizontally
- VSCode "wrap with component" snippet helped me be more productive

### Continued development

I'm happy I'm continue to explore flexbox and it's usage, and look forward to doing so. Also, the ability to visually determine how I want to split up the HTML markup and apply styles, differentiating between margin/padding/etc., and continuing to grow my experience in this.
